    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        #Lagrange's four-square theorem states that all natural numbers can be represented by the sum of at most 4 perfect squares. Therefore we only have to check for the cases 1-3, otherwise the answer is 4
        #Create list of perfect squares
        squares = []
        for i in range(int(n**.5), 0, -1):
            squares.append(i**2)
        if int(n**.5) ** 2 == n:
          return 1
        for square in squares:
          if n - square in squares:

          for square2 in squares:
            if n - (square1 + square2) in squares:
              return 3
